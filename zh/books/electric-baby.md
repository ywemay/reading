# 电娃娃

我诞生在发电厂，人们亲切地称我为“电娃娃”。我是个快乐的旅行家，我和我的兄弟姐妹们沿着电线一直走啊走啊，一点不怕累。虽然电线里黑乎乎的，什么也看不见，但是我们的脚步可不慢，因为所有的电娃娃都是急性子。

“哎哟!”你看，我刚放慢了脚步，就被后面的电娃娃踢了一脚。

我来到工厂，推动那些巨大的机器轰隆隆地运转。

我来到街边，点燃路灯，照得马路明晃晃。

我来到游乐场，摩天轮飞快转动，给小朋友们带来很多快乐。

我钻进洗衣机，洗净脏衣服。

我钻进电饭锅，煮出香米饭……

人们都说：“呀，有了电，可真方便。”

可是，也有人诅咒我：“可恶的电，伤人太厉害了!”我感到很委屈。平时，我老老实实地呆在电线里，但是如果有人碰了裸露的电线或者用手指去捅插座孔，就会和我“亲密接触”，要知道，我天生力气大，会让碰到我的人受伤。所以，请大家千万要小心，如果不小心伤了你们，我会非常难过的。

好了，我要上路了，再见!

－－－－温馨提示－－－－

我们的生活离不开电，电饭锅、电风扇、电冰箱、电吹风等，都是靠电来运转的。电给我们的生活带来很多方便，电同时又很危险。因此，小朋友们千万不能用小手去触摸电线或攀爬电线杆，要远离一切带有“高压危险”“小心触电”标志的地方。你能做到吗?

I was born in a power plant, and people affectionately called me "Electric Baby." I was a happy traveler, my brothers and sisters and I walked endlessly along the power lines, never afraid of getting tired. Although it was dark inside the wires and I couldn't see anything, we walked without slowing down, because all the Electric Babys were impatient.

"Ouch!" Look! As soon as I slowed down, I was kicked by the Electric Baby behind me.

I went to the factory, driving the huge machines that rumbled into action.

I walked to the street, turned on the streetlights, and illuminated the road brilliantly.

I went to the amusement park, where the Ferris wheel whirred away, bringing joy to the children.

I climbed into the washing machine and washed my dirty clothes.

I climbed into the rice cooker and cooked fragrant rice...

People said, "Wow, electricity is so convenient!"

But some people also cursed me, "Damn electricity! It hurts so much!" I felt wronged. Normally, I stay within the electrical wiring. However, if someone touches an exposed wire or pokes a socket with their finger, they'll come into close contact with me. Remember, I'm naturally strong and can injure anyone who touches me. So, please be careful. I'd be deeply saddened if I accidentally hurt you.

Okay, I'm on my way. Goodbye!

－－－－Warm Tips－－－－

Our lives are inseparable from electricity. Electric rice cookers, electric fans, refrigerators, hair dryers, and more all run on electricity. While electricity brings many conveniences to our lives, it can also be very dangerous. Therefore, children should never touch electrical wires or climb utility poles with their hands. Stay away from areas with signs saying "High Voltage Danger" or "Caution of Electric Shock." Can you do this?
