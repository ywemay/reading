# 袋鼠进城

袋鼠蹦蹦头一回进城，红红绿绿的灯光、嘀嘀吧吧的汽车声一下就吸引了它，蹦蹦迷上了城市，它做梦都想在城里住下来。

　　可真巧啊！城里最大的商场招聘服务员。蹦蹦挤了进去，可真巧啊！城里最大的商场招聘服务员。蹦蹦挤了进去，戴眼镜的狗熊经理一眼就盯上了它，左看右看．上看下看，直着

　　嗓门问：“你有什么本领啊？”蹦蹦挺了挺肚子，指着袋袋说：

　　“呶（náo），我有这个！”狗熊经理听了直乐：“嗯，不错，这个模样，准能吸引顾客。”心里还盘算着：哈！还有它的袋袋，能用来放商品，省去购物用的小推车了。

　　蹦蹦上班了，整个城市哄动了，买东西的、不买东西的都要来这个商场转一转。蹦蹦可喜欢这个工作了。

　　有一天，来了一位抱孩子的年轻妈妈。她特意挑选了许多商品，一件一件放在蹦蹦的袋袋里，年轻妈妈还顺手把孩子也放在了蹦蹦的口袋里。蹦蹦的口袋又暖和又舒服，孩子在袋袋里睡着了。年轻妈妈买完东西就回家去了。“喂！女士，你忘了抱回自己的孩子了。”蹦蹦急得边喊边追。可是，那位妈妈一点也没听见，她已经乘上了公共汽车。蹦蹦就去追那辆汽车：“嘻！这可是我的拿手好戏。"汽车一直开，蹦蹦就一直追，要不是袋袋里装了孩子呀，它早就追上了。路上的人说：“看哪，一只袋鼠在追公共汽车。”“是呀，它是在和公共汽车赛跑吗？”记者们开看新闻采访车跟了上去：“这是马路，不是跑道。”警察开着警车一边喊一边追了上去。等年轻妈妈从公共汽车上下来的时候，袋鼠腆着大肚子喘着气，拦在年轻妈妈的面前。粗心的妈妈这才发现她把孩子给丢了，蹦蹦也才发现自己的袋袋已经让孩子尿湿了。它头朝地做了一个倒立，倒掉袋袋里面的尿，围观的人群郁笑了。

　　等蹦蹦回到商场．天色已经晚了。电视里正放着“袋鼠追汽车”的新闻．警察在电视上说：“袋鼠蹦蹦已经违反了城市交通规则，它应该立刻离开城市。”狗熊经理板着脸说：“袋鼠蹦蹦随便离开自己的岗位，它被解雇了。”

　　蹦蹦只好卷起铺盖回森林里去。

“嘟、嘟——”蹦蹦的身后传来了汽车的声音。蹦蹦回头一看．啊．许多的汽车向它开了过来，新闻采访车也开采了。蹦蹦不知道发生了什么事，拼命逃，汽车就拼命追。最后，汽车从四面围住了蹦蹦．那位忘了孩子的年轻妈妈从汽车里走出来，说：“别走，可爱的蹦蹦。”许多城市里的居民都说：“是的，别走，我们大家喜欢你。”

　　乡下来的袋鼠蹦蹦被弄糊涂了，怎么？我又能留在城里了吗？

　　是的，电视里正在播放“汽车追袋鼠”的新闻，并且说！“它是一位十分尽职的服务员。只要它以后稍稍注意一下交通规则。”短短一天：一袋鼠蹦蹦两次上了电视，已经成了这个城市的明星。

　　蹦蹦可不懂这些，不过，它很高兴。因为，它知道，像它这样认认真真做事，无论是在乡下还是城市都是受欢迎的。

Kangaroo Bong Bong was in the city for the first time. The bright red and green lights and the honking of cars immediately captivated him. Bong Bong was fascinated by the city and dreamed of living there.

What a coincidence! The city's largest shopping mall was hiring waiters. Bong Bong squeezed in. What a coincidence! The city's largest shopping mall was hiring waiters. Bong Bong squeezed in. The bespectacled bear manager immediately took notice, looking him left and right, up and down.

He asked loudly, "What are your specialties?" Bong Bong puffed out his belly and pointed at his pouch.

"Hey, I have this!" The bear manager laughed. "Yeah, not bad! This will definitely attract customers." He thought to himself, "Ha! And his pouch can be used to store goods, eliminating the need for a shopping cart."

Bong Bong's start of work set the whole city ablaze. Shoppers and those not shopping flocked to the mall to explore. Bong Bong loved his job. One day, a young mother arrived with her child. She had carefully selected a number of items, placing them one by one in a Bong Bong bag. She also placed her child in Bong Bong's pocket. Bong Bong's pocket was warm and comfortable, and the child fell asleep inside. After shopping, the young mother returned home. "Hey, lady, you forgot to bring your child back?" Bong Bong shouted anxiously, chasing after her. But the mother didn't hear a thing; she had already boarded a bus. Bong Bong chased the bus: "Hey! This is my specialty." The bus kept moving, and Bong Bong kept chasing. If it hadn't been carrying the child in its bag, it would have caught up long ago. Passersby said, "Look! A kangaroo is chasing the bus." "Yes, is it racing with the bus?" Reporters in a news car followed: "This is a road, not a racetrack." The police chased after it in their police car, shouting. As the young mother got off the bus, the kangaroo, panting and with its bulging belly, blocked her path. The careless mother then realized she had lost her child. Bong Bong also realized his pouch was soaked with urine. He did a headstand and dumped the urine out of his pouch, which amused the onlookers.

By the time Bong Bong returned to the mall, it was already late. The news story about the "kangaroo chasing a car" was playing on TV. The police officer announced, "Kangaroo Bong Bong has violated city traffic regulations and should leave the city immediately." The bear manager said sternly, "Kangaroo Bong Bong has left his post without permission. He is fired."

Bong Bong had no choice but to pack up his blankets and return to the forest.

"Beep, beep—" Cars squeaked behind Bong Bong. Bong Bong looked back. Aha! Several cars were approaching, including a news van. Bong Bong, not knowing what was happening, fled desperately, and the cars chased him. Finally, the cars surrounded Bong Bong from all sides. The young mother who had forgotten her child stepped out of the car and called out, "Don't go, sweet Bengbeng." Many city residents responded, "Yes, don't go. We all love you."

Bengbeng, the country kangaroo, was bewildered. What? Could he stay in the city again?

Yes, the TV was broadcasting the news story about the car chasing the kangaroo, and it was saying, "He's a very dedicated waiter. If he just pays a little attention to traffic rules from now on." In just one day, Bengbeng, the kangaroo, had appeared on TV twice and had become a star in the city.

Bengbeng didn't understand any of this, but he was happy. He knew that people like him who work diligently are welcome, whether in the countryside or in the city.
